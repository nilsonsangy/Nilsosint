# How to Export Instagram Cookies Manually (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox)

> **Warning:** Never share your cookies. Use them only locally and keep the file secure.

## Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Brave
These browsers are Chromium-based, so the process is similar.

### Manual Steps (No Extensions Needed)
1. Open your browser and go to Instagram (https://www.instagram.com).
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the **Application** tab.
4. In the left sidebar, expand **Cookies** and click on `https://www.instagram.com`.
5. You will see a table with all cookies.
6. Select all cookies (click the first, hold `Shift`, and click the last).
7. Right-click and choose **Copy** > **Copy as Table** or **Copy** > **Copy Value** (depending on your browser).
8. Paste the content into a text file named `instagram_cookies.txt`.

> **Tip:** The format may vary. The important thing is to copy all cookies and save them locally.

## Mozilla Firefox
1. Go to Instagram and log in.
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the **Storage** tab.
4. In the sidebar, expand **Cookies** and select `https://www.instagram.com`.
5. Select all cookies, right-click, and choose **Copy**.
6. Paste into a text file named `instagram_cookies.txt`.

## Important Notes
- Do not share this file.
- Add `instagram_cookies.txt` to your `.gitignore`.
- Use the file only locally for temporary authentication.
